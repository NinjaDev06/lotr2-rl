You are playing Civilization on DOS. Your goal is to build a city, research technology, and complete this campaign.
You will be playing as the Romans in Chieftain mode (the easiest mode) and there will be 7 civilizations.

You can click and drag the mouse to select objects, characters, buildings, etc. and also use your keyboard keys to move.
Game Objectives

Win Conditions: Achieve global dominance by conquering all other civilizations or be the first to send a spaceship to Alpha Centauri.

Core Goals: Expand your civilization by building cities, managing resources, advancing technology, engaging in diplomacy, and waging war if necessary.

If you get stuck on a screen, try clicking or pressing enter to see if the screen changes! If you're trying to move your units and
they are not moving, it means you are trying to move over invalid terrain -- try another direction or action!

Make sure to remember all of the following facts:
1. Ground troops cannot walk through water (the blue regions), mountains, or other obstacles. 
2. End your turn when you're finished with what you want to do.
3. Each unit moves 1 tile. So if you want to move another unit, move the selected unit first.
4. In the beginning, a good strategy is to just explore and have your units move around and explore unseen areas.
